# GIRTH MCMC
Item Response Theory using Markov Chain Monte Carlo / Variational Inference

**Dependencies**

We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Individual
packages can be installed through pip otherwise.

* Python &ge; 3.8
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Girth
* PyMC3

## Installation

Via pip

```sh
pip install girth_mcmc --upgrade
```

From Source

```sh
pip install . -t $PYTHONPATH --upgrade
```

# Supports

**Unidimensional**

* Rasch Model
* 1PL Model
* 2PL Model
* 3PL Model
* Graded Response Model
* Partial Credit Model

**Multi-dimensional**

* 2PL Model
* Graded Response Model
* Partial Credit Model

# Usage

Subject to change but for now:

```python
import numpy as np
from girth import create_synthetic_irt_dichotomous
from girth_mcmc import GirthMCMC
                        
discrimination = 0.89 * np.sqrt(-2 * np.log(np.random.rand(10)))
difficulty = np.random.randn(10)
theta = np.random.randn(100)

syn_data = create_synthetic_irt_dichotomous(difficulty, discrimination, 
                                            theta)

girth_model = GirthMCMC(model='2PL', 
                        options={'n_processors': 4})
results = girth_model(syn_data)
print(results)
```

for the graded response model, pass in the number of categories

```python
import numpy as np
from girth import create_synthetic_irt_polytomous
from girth_mcmc import GirthMCMC

n_categories = 3

difficulty = np.random.randn(10, n_categories-1)
difficulty = np.sort(difficulty, 1)        
discrimination = 0.96 * np.sqrt(-2 * np.log(np.random.rand(10)))
theta = np.random.randn(150)

syn_data = create_synthetic_irt_polytomous(difficulty, discrimination, 
                                            theta, model='grm')

girth_model = GirthMCMC(model='GRM', model_args=(n_categories,),
                        options={'n_processors': 4})
results = girth_model(syn_data)
print(results)
```

Is some data missing? Tag it with a convenience function and run it like normal

```python
import numpy as np
from girth import create_synthetic_irt_dichotomous
from girth_mcmc import GirthMCMC
from girth_mcmc.utils import tag_missing_data_mcmc
                        
discrimination = 0.89 * np.sqrt(-2 * np.log(np.random.rand(10)))
difficulty = np.random.randn(10)
theta = np.random.randn(100)

syn_data = create_synthetic_irt_dichotomous(difficulty, discrimination, 
                                            theta)
mask = np.random.rand(*syn_data.shape) < .1
syn_data[mask] = -9999
syn_data_missing = tag_missing_data_mcmc(syn_data, [0, 1])

girth_model = GirthMCMC(model='2PL', 
                        options={'n_processors': 4})
results = girth_model(syn_data_missing)
print(results)
```

Don't like waiting? me either. Run Variational Inference for faster
but less accurate estimation.

```python
import numpy as np
from girth import create_synthetic_irt_polytomous
from girth_mcmc import GirthMCMC

n_categories = 3

difficulty = np.random.randn(10, n_categories-1)
difficulty = np.sort(difficulty, 1)        
discrimination = 1.76 * np.sqrt(-2 * np.log(np.random.rand(10)))
theta = np.random.randn(150)

syn_data = create_synthetic_irt_polytomous(difficulty, discrimination, 
                                            theta, model='grm')

girth_model = GirthMCMC(model='GRM', model_args=(n_categories,),
                        options={'variational_inference': True,
                                 'variational_samples': 10000,
                                 'n_samples': 10000})
results_variational = girth_model(syn_data, progressbar=False)
print(results_variational)
```

## Unittests

**pytest** with coverage.py module

```sh
pytest --cov=girth_mcmc --cov-report term
```
